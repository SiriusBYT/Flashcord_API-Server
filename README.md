# Flashcord-Store-API
Pre-SirioNetworkAPI Python Server Back-end for the Flashstore API.

## NOTICE: This code is now deprecated and (will be) replaced by the Sirio Network API.
This repo is now publicly available so you can laugh at my shitty code.

It should contain every major rewrite or major change of the API Server here I think, this repo is a mess and I really don't care anymore since I'm working on the SN-API

##### Notice: This code is public domain.
